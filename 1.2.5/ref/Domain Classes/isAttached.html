		<h1>isAttached</h1><p class="paragraph"/><h2>Purpose</h2><p class="paragraph"/>Returns whether the domain instance is attached to a currently active session or not. This method is often used on conjunction with the <a href="../../ref/Domain Classes/merge.html" class="domainClasses">merge</a> or <a href="../../ref/Domain Classes/attach.html" class="domainClasses">attach</a> methods.<p class="paragraph"/><h2>Examples</h2><p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>Book b = session.book
&#8230;
<span class="java&#45;keyword">if</span>(!b.isAttached()) &#123;
	b.attach()
&#125;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/><h2>Description</h2><p class="paragraph"/>Grails uses Hibernate which manages each persistent object in a persistence session. A new session is created per request and is closed at the end of the request. If an object is read from the session and placed into a web scope such as the HttpSession it is seen as detached, since the persistence session has been closed. You can use the <a href="../../ref/Domain Classes/attach.html" class="domainClasses">attach</a> method to re-attach an existing persistent instance to the persistence session of the current request.
